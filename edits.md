## Suggested Edits for your Resume
##### from Aubrey Shuga

- The title of your resume still says "Brigham Young's Resume" up in the tab name. I think that's line 3 of the code.
- The links at the top work great
- Everything up through Experience looks good
- Sorry I don't have time to review it more in-depth :)
- Don't forget to change the bottom part with the example stuff (or if you already changed it - push your changes!)

Great job!
